I have complete the Learning react course including exercises that make me motivated to master react js. Today, I have covered component classes, compose components, conditional rendering, events, redering lists and object lists. I will try to explain more clear on the topics mentioned before
The component class extends React.component variables, and render function that is vital. Most importantly, ReactDOM shoud render the compponent class to desplace the component in browser.

composing components is utilizing one component in other components. Conditional redering is varying the content the browser based on parameters passed to the component. We can also perform conditional rendering by events like button click, which is also called rendering by events. We can also render list and list objects by map function.

I have learned how to use create-react-app to create react project with proper folder structure. Now, i even know how to run, build and prodction ready build using below npm commands. 

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
